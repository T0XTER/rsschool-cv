## 3 Summary ##
Since childhood, I wanted to become a programmer. So after graduating from university, I started to self-study Web programming. In the fall of 2019, I got into Geekhub courses on Frontend + CMS. After graduation, I continued my self-study and tried to get into one of Javascript courses . I'm doing my best to learn fast. Now I am motivated to find a job in the IT field more than ever.
